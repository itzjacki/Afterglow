Afterglow (2020)

This is the repository for my 2020 ground-up remake of the hit rhythm game Afterglow (2018), which was voted "most addictive" at the 2018 TDT4100 award cerimony. The franchise has a whopping 2 active players, both of whom are eagerly looking forward to this sequel.

As of September 2020, other projects have taken precendence, so progress has been slow since I started in May. There is, however, a playable super-early demo available which shows of the core mechanics. About 90 seconds of playable song has been mapped in the demo.

Thanks for checking it out!
